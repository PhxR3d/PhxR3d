Hiya! I'm PhoenixRed! (Call me Red, Phoenix, or Nix)

# Here's some stuff about me lol
## Pronouns

## Stuff I wanna do
- I want to make a large scale FNF mod. (Maybe a fangame in the future idk.)

### Anyway- I hope you enjoyed reading this- and whatever projects I work on lol. Have a great day or night or existence.
